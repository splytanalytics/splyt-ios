The SPLYT SDK for iOS {#mainpage}
=========

Welcome!  This SDK allows you to integrate your iOS apps with SPLYT, which provides analytics and insights about your app.  In addition, SPLYT empowers you with the ability to take actions that will improve users' engagement with your app.

This documentation includes the following resources to help you on your way:

1. If you're new to SPLYT, you may want to have a look at our [introduction to contextual data in SPLYT](md_intro-context_intro-context.html).  It gives an overview of the motivation behind SPLYT's transaction-based telemetry.
2. Next, a quick way to get started is to [run our sample iOS game, called BubblePop](md_sample-walkthrough_sample-walkthrough.html).
3. Once you've tried the sample, you'll want to [add SPLYT to your own app](md_adding-splyt_adding-splyt.html).
4. Finally, you'll want to add telemetry code to your game or app.  We have [some tips to help you get started](md_gettingstarted_gettingstarted.html).

If you encounter any problems along the way, our support team is here to help.  Just send a note to [support@splyt.com](mailto:support@splyt.com) and we'll respond right away.
